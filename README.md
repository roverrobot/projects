Projects Wiki (Dokuwiki plugin)

This plugin allows dokuwiki to represent files. It also create a makefile like logical relationships between "source files" and "generated files", and allow the running of scripts (bash or any other handler using the #! directive). It thus allows the dokuwiki to act like a project development environment. It also presents a huge security risk on open wikis as it allows anyone to execute arbitrary scripts on the server.
